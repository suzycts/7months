		<div></div>
		<div>7 months with</div>
		<div>Continue</div>
		<div>I turned the lights off and we both sat on the couch together with blanket I gave you  in case
 you got scared… You did, indeed,      get scared. You looked so fucking cute. And that was
when…….. I found myself wanting to kiss you...
</div>
		<div>April 2017

Dean’s house
</div>
		<div>We should listen to scary stories then. You won’t be alone anyway. You
can stay with me tonight.</div>
		<div>If I listen to scary stories I won’t be able to sleep at night...
</div>
		<div>Tonight, I have a boy in my house. I haven’t said anything about it just yet, but I think he’s really
cute. He told me listening to scary stories would make it hard for him to sleep at night….
I hope I’m not cruel for what I’m about to do. </div>
		<div>It was sometime during those moments that I began to develop feelings for you.
</div>
		<div>After that, we argued about who was going to sleep in my bed that night
and who would sleep on the floor…
We ended up sleeping together and I held you.

</div>
		<div>All I did was call you cute in that moment. I didn’t kiss you.
Although, I would have given anything to have been able 
to do so.
</div>
		<div>Now it’s been a full seven months since you and I have been dating and I can’t express how fucking lucky. I feel to have you be a part of my life. I know I’ve said this a lot recently, but I have no idea where I would be right now if I didn’t have you. I would probably be a fucking dirty pile of laundry without you. Thank you for everything that you’ve done for me. Really, you’ve made me feel so much better on gloomy days and made me believe a little more in myself. I feel like every time I wake up, whether it’s from a nap or from actual sleep, I have a genuine reason to smile and be happy. And with all the crap that I’ve been dealing with lately, it’s really the best feeling in the world. I’m really thankful because I got the chance to meet you when I did. You’re honestly such an amazing person and you have the biggest heart ever. You’re like 90% heart and 10% person. It really amazes me that you’re a real person because you’re just too good to be true. Thank you for always putting in so much effort for me and cheering me up when I’m down. And thank you for all the hugs and kisses and smiles. All the jokes and dog pictures, and all the memories we’ve made throughout these past months. I couldn’t have spent this time any better than I did. I love you with all my heart.</div>
